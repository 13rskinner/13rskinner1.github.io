          A Linear Accelerator, often shortened to Linac, is a type of particle accelerator that accelerates subatomic particles along a linear beamline using a series of oscillating electric potentials.

      <h3>How do Linacs work?</h3>
      <p>
        Let’s imagine that we want to accelerate a batch of protons. To do this, we will need a potential difference between the proton source and the target. Therefore, the first tube is provided with a negative potential which attracts the protons causing them to accelerate towards it. Once the protons reach the first drift tube, they travel through at a constant velocity. However, to accelerate the protons to the velocities necessary, more than one cycle of acceleration will be required as the potential difference required to complete the acceleration in one cycle would be unimaginably large.

        Therefore, a series of drift tubes are used alongside an alternating potential difference. This means that once the protons pass through the first drift tube, the potential of the second drift tube alternates from positive to negative causing the protons to accelerate towards the second tube. The protons then travel through the second drift tube until it reaches the end of it when the potential of the 3rd drift tube becomes negative with respect to the second drift tube causing another cycle of acceleration. This process occurs until the velocity of the protons is sufficient for the task you want to complete. So that the frequency of the alternating potential difference can remain constant, the drift tubes become increasingly longer to compensate for the increased velocities of the protons.

      <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
      <p>
        When the first linear accelerator was constructed by Rolf Widerøe in 1928, it had many advantages to the other methods of particle acceleration at the time. This is because the electrostatic accelerators at the time such as the Cockcroft-Walton accelerator and Van de Graaff generator only accelerated the particles once with an applied voltage. The linear accelerator enabled paticles to be accelerated multiple times over so they weren't limited by the accelerating voltage.

        Another advantage of Linacs is that they enable the production of electrons at relativistic speeds as electrons travelling at near light speed velocity lose energy through synchotron radiation when they travel in an arc which limits the velocity which synchotrons can accelerate electorns to.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, linear accelerators are far from perfect as the speed that the particles can reach is limited by the length of the accelerator. As the particles only pass through the accelerator once, the only way to accelerate the particles further is to increase the length of the Linac which is dpendant on the available space in the area.
      </p>
      <h3>Uses</h3>
      <p>
        Linacs have a broad array of uses in industry, the most common of which being medical linacs which are used for cancer treatment. These medical linacs accelerate electrons to energies between 4 and 25MeV which are then fired at a high-density target such as tungsten which rapidly decelerates the electrons as they collide with atomic electrons causing them to emit radiation in the form of X-rays. This occurs because when charged particles are accelerated or decelerated, they emit electromagnetic radiation called Bremsstrahlung radiation. The high energy x-rays are then shaped as they exit the machine to conform to the shape of the patient's tumor and the customized beam is directed to the patient's tumor.

        The production of X-rays from linear accelerators give them broad uses across industries such as treating wastewater and sterilising food or medical apparatus.

        Linacs can also be used to produce radioisotopes which have a broad array of applications in medicine and industry. The expected shortages of molybdenum-99 and the technetium-99 medical isotope obtained from it has shed light on how linacs can be used to produce molybdenum-99 from Uranium-235 through neutron bombardment.
