      <h3>How do synchotrons work?</h3>
      <p>
        Synchotrons are particle accelerators which confine particles in a circle of constant radius and are able to accelerate particles to relativistic speeds unlike <a href="cyclotron.html">cyclotrons</a>. The particles are contained in a circular path with electromagnets positioned around the outside of the accelerator and are accelerated by electric fields in 'radio frequency cavities'. Synchrotrons are unable to accelerate particles from zero kinetic energy as its closed particle path would be cut by a device that emits particles. Therefore, the particles are initially accelerated using a device such as a <a href="linac.html">Linac</a> and then injected into the synchotron. To further accelerate the particles, the accelerators are fitted with metallic chambers containing an electromagnetic field known as radiofrequency (RF) cavities which provide an electrical impulse to charged particles which enter it.

      <p>
        To ensure that the particles remain in the same circular path as they gain velocity, the magnitude of the magnetic field has to be increased continuously. The maximum energy that a cyclic accelerator can impart is typically limited by the maximum strength of the magnetic fields and the minimum radius of the particle path. Therefore, to maximise the magnetic field strength, superconducting electromagnets are used which are not limited by the magnetic saturation of the material. For the electromagnets to become superconducting, their temperature must be kept extremely low, close to absolute zero. This is achieved using vast amounts of liquid helium. The other way in which the kinetic energy of the particles is maximised is by increasing the radius of the synchotron as the LHC has done by building an accelerator with a circumference of 27km. Furthermore, to ensure that the particles do not intefere with particles in the air, they travel through an evacuated tube which has a vacuum inside it.

      <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
      <p>
        The main advantage of a synchotron over a cyclotron is that it is able to accelerate particles to relativistic speeds allowing particle physicists to probe the fundamental constituents of matter. However, unlike cyclotrons, synchotrons are unable to accelerate particles in a continuous stream and instead have to inject particles in batches. This is because, the strength of the magnetic field needed for particles staright after injection is far less than the magnetic field strength required for particles which have done many revolutions.

        A by-product of a synchotron's operation is synchotron radiation which is radiation emitted when charged particles are accelerated in a curved path or orbit. This can reuslt in the emission of photons of up to x-ray frequencies as the charged particles are deflected by the electromagnets and undergo radial acceleration. This means that extra power must be supplied to the beam to compensate for the energy loss, however, the synchotron radiation can be valuable as it is often used in other experiments.

      <h3>Uses</h3>
      <p>
        The main application of synchotrons comes from the fact that as the charged particles are deflected around in a circular path, they emit electromagnetic radiation as high as x-ray frequencies. This radiation is then channelled down beamlines to workstations where it is used for research purposes in:

        Synchotrons are also used in high energy particle physics to collide particles at energies of up to 13TeV in order to understand the components of matter. Particle physicists use them in order to discover new particles as well as refine our understanding of particles that we already know exist. Currently, particle physicists are eager to discover dark matter particles which would finally explain why galaxies are rotating faster than expected. They are also using them to test theories such as supersymmetry and determine whether there are any other forces that we do not yet know about in the Universe.

      <p>There is also research being done in the role that synchotrons could play in treating cancer. Currently, most patients being trated for cancer receive radiotherapy which has limitations as it causes damage to healthy tissue as the tumour is targetted with a broad beam X-ray meaning that the  radiation dose administered must be delivered over several days to give the normal tissue time to recover. Synchrotron Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT) is a radiotherapy technique that treats tumors with narrow wafers of very high doses of synchrotron radiation and is delivered in very short amounts of time. . Interestingly, normal tissue can tolerate X-ray doses 100 times greater than conventional radiotherapy when delivered by MRT. This could enable the treatment of cancer in areas of the body such as the endometrium while also maintaining its normal function.
