      <h3>Synchotrons</h3>
      <h4 id="1">1) Large Hadron Collider (LHC)</h4>
      <p>
        The Large Hadron Collider is the world's largest, most powerful particle accelerator with a circumference of 27km and a collision energy of 13TeV. Since construction finished in 2008 it has proven extrmely valuable to physicists as it proved the existence of the Higgs Boson, the particle which gives fundamental articles their masss, in 2012. This finally completed the Standard Model by proving a theory put forward in the 1960s. However, the workof the LHC is far fromcomplete as there asre still many aspects of the Universe which we do not understand. But first let's analyse how the LHC works.
      </p>

      <p>
        The particles are accelerated through a tube containing an ultrahigh vacuum as empty as the interstellar void to stop air particles intefering with accelerating beams. The LHC is able to accelerate particles up to 99.9999991% the speed of light by using radiofrequency cavities positioned around the tube to provide an electrical impulse to charged particles which enter it. In order to confine the particles moving at such high velocities, extrmely powerful, superconducting electromagnets are needed around the perimeter which must be kept at -271.3°C, a temperature colder than outer space. It is clear for all to see that the LHC is a true feat of modern engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the LHC, two beams are accelerated simultaneously and then made to intersect at 4 main locations where the detectors (CMS, LHCb, ATLAS and ALICE) are housed. In order to maximise the probability of collision between the particles, magnets are used just before the two beams intersect to squeeze the particles together. When the particles collide, a shower of particles are produced and the detectors are used to measure the energy, charge and mass of the particles produced. The CMS detector uses a powerful magnet to bend charged particles as they fly outwards from the collision point which helps to identify the charge of the particle (positive and negative charges bend in opposite directions) and the momentum of the particle as particles with higher momomentum bend less. The energy of the particles is also measured using two types of calorimeter- an electromagnetic calorimeter which measures the energy of photons and electrons by stopping them completley and a hadronic calorimeter which measures the energy of particles formed of quarks.

      <p>
        This data is extremeley valuable to particle physicists as it helps them to analyse the properties of particles we currently know of and potentially find new particles beyond the Standard Model. Due to the vast amounts of collisions which occur (approximatley 1 billion per second generating a petabyte of data per second) machine learning algoriths are put in place to sort through the data and identify interesting collisions which may point to the existence of new physics.

        As we mentioned earlier, there are still many un-answered questions and theories which need verifying. One of the main aims of the detectors at the LHC is to detect dark matter which is a theorised type of matter which permeates the Universe to expalin why galaxies are rotating faster than expected. However, if dark matter does exist, it will be extremely difficult to detect as it does not interact with light and only interact extrmelely weakly with matter. Therefore, its existence could be infered from missing energy in collisions. Physicists at the LHC also want to understand why the Universe appears to be comprised almost exclusively of matter, not anti-matter by exploring slight asymmetries which may occur during particle interactions. Furthermore, there is a storng desire in the physics community to incorporate gravity into the Standard Model and create a Grand Unified Theory which would unify the known forces of nature. Howevever, many in the physics community believe that there could be other forces acting in the Universe beyond the four fundamental forces that we know of (strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravitational) and they are attempting to find evidence of this at the LHC.

        The LHC is a truly magnificent feat of human ingenuity and one of humanity's great accomplishments. It is at the epicentre of high energy particle physics and is pushing the boundaries of our current understanding of the Universe. While there is no guarantee that it will be able to discover physics beyond the Standard Model, physicists remain excited as plans for the even more powerful 100km circumference Future Circular Collider have been drawn up around the outside of the LHC which may finally help us answer our most profound questions about the Universe.

      <h4 id="2">2) The Australian Synchotron</h4>
      <p>This 3GeV, 316m circumference particle accelerator located in the suburbs of Melbourne is the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. The device accelerates electrons to near light speeds resulting in the emission of synchotron radiation which is then directed towards experimental work stations which perfrom research in advanced materials, biomedicine, defence science, environmental sustainability and electronics. But before we delve into the research performed at the Australian Synchotron, let's understand how it works.

        The electrons are provided their first boost of acceleration using an electron gun before they enter the <a href="linac.html">Linac</a> which accelerates the electron beam to an energy of 100 MeV, over a distance of around 15 metres. The electrons then pass into the booster synchotron which uses 5 radio frequency cavities around the 130m circumference to increase the energy of the particles to 3GeV before being sent into the main, 216m circumference stroage ring. Around the outside of the storage ring are long pipelines, known as beamlines which the synchotron radiation passes down towards the experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
        A whole array of scientists from different disciplines have used the Austalian Synchotron demonstrating the value of these devices in furthering human knowledge. Most recently, it has been used to map the molecular structure of the COVID-19 virus in its attempt to help understand and combat the virus. The value of the Australian Synchotron is that it can produce x-rays which are millions of times brighter than those produced by conventional x-ray machines in laboratories and hospitals enabling an impressive array of non-destructive, high-resolution, rapid, in-situ, real-time imaging and analysis techniques.This enables scientists to extract the structural and chemical information from a diverse range of samples such as intelligent materials and living tissue.

        Due to its high precision imaging, the Australian synchotron has been used in many areas of industry. One of these areas is in medicine where it has been used to research new diagnostic, imaging and therapeutic techniques while pharmaceuticals companies have also employed it to analyse proteins, nucleic acids and viruses as well as assess potential drugs. Furthermore, the Australian Synchotron is used extensively to research advanced materials such as semi-conductors, superconductors, battery materials and opto-electronics as well as the manufacture of nano-technology. In addition to that, it has been used by environmental scientists to explore atmospheric samples and pollutants while it has also been used for agricultural research to analyse plant genomics and soil composition. It has also been used to perform research in manufacturing to understand the strength of certain materials as well as in forensics to improve the ability of law enforcement to identify suspects when there is limited samples.

      This demonstrates the wide vareity of uses which synchotrons can have and how they are extremeley valuable to us for advancing human knowledge. Since opening in 2007 it has helped to support thousands of researchers in their attempts to tackle global problems such as the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer and malaria. It is at the cutting-edge of synchotron research and is a truly vital asset in the development of our scientific knowledge.

      <h4 id="3">The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility</h4>
      <p>
        After being built in 1994, the The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) has led the way in cutting-edge, synchotron based research. Situated in Grenoble, France, it acts as the global epicentre for synchotron research as it is supported by 19 countries worldwide, has an annual budget of around 80 million Euros and hosts approximatley 8000 scientists each year carrying out 2000 experiments in subjects ranging from archaeology and environmental science to nano-technology and structural biology. It is a major feat of engineering with a circumference of 844m it can produce x-ray light 100 billion times brighter than those in hospitals whilst operating 24 hours each day. Let's begin by understanding how the synchotron works.

        <p>
          Initially, the electrons are accelerated using a <a href="linac.html">Linac</a> which brings the electrons to an energy of 200MeV before they are sent into the booster synchotron which has a circumference of 300m. The electrons travel around this several thousand times before reaching a final energy of 6GeV when they are sent into the main storage ring. The 844m circumference storage ring is surrounded by powerful electromagnets which contain and direct the electron beams. These magnets are vital as they cause the electorns to change direction resulting in them emitting synchotron radiation with frequncies up to X-rays. In total, 3 types of magnets are used:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bending Magnets</strong>- These force the electrons to change direction and are a source of synchrotron light, which is emitted tangentially to the curved path of the electron beam and is directed towards the beamlines.</li>
          <li><strong>Undulators</strong>- These are magnetic structures made up of a series of small magnets with alternating polarity. The beams of X-rays they produce are a million times more intense than those generated by the bending magnets and have brightness and coherence properties that are close to lasers.</li>
          <li><strong>Focusing Magnets</strong>- These are used to focus the electron beam so that it is as narrow as possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The synchotron radiation produced is then directed down 44 beamlines which have cutting edge-equipment in them to carty out the experiments. So what are the experiments which scientists carry out in these beamlines?</p>

        </center>
        <p>
          Because of the quality of the high intensity x-rays produced by the ESRF, it acts like a super-microscope which is able to look into the very heart of matter to understand the secrets of living tissue and explore the potential of new materials. The experiments cover a broad, cross-section of subjects including: condensed matter science, materials science, structural biology, medicine, environmental science, engineering and cultural heritage. Recently, it has been used extensively to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in order to understand the structure of the virus so that we can have a greater understanding of how to stop its spread. Overall, the aim of the ESRF is to tackle humanity's big problems such as: inventing targetted medicines, finding more effective cancer treatments, developing semiconductors for electronics, improving energy management contributing to the production of healthier food. Since operation began, the ESRF has made a number of fascinating findings including the discovery of a new species of dinosaur which lived about 72 million years ago in 2017. It is a mix between a velociraptor, an ostrich and a swan with a crocodile muzzle and penguin wings, with a height of about 1.2 meters and with killer claws. It was also used to help read ancient texts from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79AD which had been reduced to the status of charred cylinders.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ESRF conveys the ability of synchotrons to answer the broadest questions that we may have. Whether these questions are about archaeology or molecular biology, the ESRF can aid your research. Excitement is growing within the scientific community after tests began in January 2020 following an upgrade whcih began in 2018 as scientists hope to use the improved synchotron to delve deeper into the structure of matter than ever before.

          <h3>Cyclotrons</h3>
          <h4 id="4">1) 88-Inch Cyclotron</h4>
          <p>
            Tucked away behind a 10-foot-thick wall of 50,000-pound concrete bricks at UC Berkeley is the 300 tonne 88-Inch Cyclotron. It is an historic piece of scientific apparatus having been built in 1961. Despite this, it remains operational today and has helped to provide valuable insights into nuclear structure, astrophysics and heavy elements.

            Over the years, it has made a number of ground-breaking discoveries by accelerating ions from hydrogen through to uranium with energies up to a few hundred million electron volts.  In 1999, physicists using the 88-Inch Cyclotron announced the discovery of two new "superheavy" elements by accelerating a beam of krypton-86 ions to an energy of 449 million electron volts and firing the beam into targets of lead-208. This resulted in the production of Oganesson, an element with 188 protons in its nucleus which quickly decayed into Livermorium through alpha decay starting a chain reaction of nuclear decays. These elements are exceptional as they are far heavier than the largest found in nature such as Uranium which contains just 92 protons. These far heavier elements can only be synthesized in nuclear reactors or particle accelerators. Though often short-lived, these artificial elements provide scientists with valuable insights into the structure of atomic nuclei and offer opportunities to study the chemical properties of the heaviest elements beyond uranium.

            More recently, the 88-Inch Cyclotron has played a key role in testing technology which is sent to space to control everything from personal cell phones and online banking transactions to spacecraft exploring the solar system and beyond. The cyclotron is used to accelerate ions before blasting them at electronic computer chips destined for space to ensure that the technology can withstand the radiation it will face in outer space, outside the protective shielding of Earth’s magnetic field. The cyclotorn’s latest work has involved bombarding parts of NASA’s new Mars-bound spacecraft, Orion, before its multi year manned mission to the planet by 2030. This testing is vital as the radiation can destroy the chips which help deliver global communication or control navigation on spacecraft. Since it began testing electronics for satellites destined for space in 1979, it has played a key role in tests for Mars’s Rovers, Space Shuttles and the Voyager satellite. The 88-Inch Cyclotron is crucial as it ensures the safety of our space missions and helps to enable reliable communications across the globe.

            Despite lacking the firepower of the world's largest synchotron, the 88-Inch Cyclotron proves that sheer size and power is not everything when it comes to scientific research. To this day, it continues to provide valuable insights into the structure of matter and allows us to send electronic into space which will be able to withstand the brutal conditions there. The 88-Inch Cyclotron is both historic and innovative, making it one of the world's most special particle accelerators.

          <h4 id="5">2) National Research Cyclotron</h4>
          <p>
            Based in Sydney, Australia, the 18MeV National Research Cyclotron has been providing medical scientists with crucial radioisotopes used in PET and SPECT imaging to investigate molecules that have a role in neurological disorders and many other diseases since it began operation in 2011. The cyclotron is connected to Australia's most advanced radio-labelling and pre-clinical imaging facility which is used to study molecular probes as they move through the body. These probes enable the measurement of molecules and proteins in the body with incredible sensitivity providing superb images.

            The Natioanl Research Cyclotron accelerates beams of protons in a spiral pattern using an oscillating electric field and a constant magnetic field which are then directed at atoms to produce radioisotopes which are then used for imaging of living tissue. One of the most common radioisotopes produced at the National Research Cyclotron is fluorine-18 which is used in positron emission tomography (PET scan) to provide images of the brain, cardiac, tumours and identify infections. Fluorine-18 decays by emitting positrons which then collide with electrons in the body resulting in the emission of gamma radiation. This radiation is then detected providing superb 3D images of the body's internal features.

            The Natioanl Research Cyclotron also enables single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans which provide 3D images of the body's internal features as well as data on how blood flows through arteries and veins in the brain. Tests have shown that it might be more sensitive to brain injury than either MRI or CT scanning because it can detect reduced blood flow to injured sites. This type of scanning is also useful in diagnosing stress fractures in the spine, blood deprived areas of brain following a stroke, and tumors. Similarly to PET scans, it works using a radioisotope and a gamma camera to detect radiation. However, in SPECT scans, the radioisotope produces the gamma radiation directly rather than producing positrons which then emit gamma radiation when they collide with electrons. Scientists hope to use the cyclotron's radisotopes to better understand comlex neurological disorders so that they can look for treatments and preventative measures.

            The first stage of operation at TRIUMF is obtaining negatively charged hydrogen ions, containing 2 electrons and 1 proton, from an ion source and transporting them along the 60m evacuated electrostatic beamline to the cyclotron. The ions are then accelerated using a high frequncy alternating potential and contained with a powerful electromagnet. To produce a proton beam, very thin layers of graphite extraction foil are inserted which strip the electrons from the hydrogen ions leaving the protons to accelerate freely. Impressively, it takes just 0.3 milliseconds for the proton beam to reach 75% of the speed of light.

            These proton beams are vital for the research which goes on at TRIUMF as it helps produce radioisotopes of carbon, fluorine and nitrogen whcih are used in PET scans. This has enabled researchers at TRIUMF to obtain superb images of the brain whcih has helped them to develop an understanding of the origins, progression, and therapies of diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. TRIUMF has also been used to deliver proton beam therapy to treat 200 patients with ocular melanoma which has had a revolutionary impact as before it was developed the most common treatment was removal of the eye. Due to the proton's being directed carefully in a narrow beam with specific energies, the damage to healthy tissue is minimised allowing patients to retain useful vision.This research is having a revolutionary impact on thousands across the globe helping to provide a better quality of life in the face of adversity.

            Furthermore, the TRIUMF Cyclotron has proven valuable in space exploration by providing energetic protons and neutrons which simulate radiation exposure in space. Even at low intensity, several minutes of exposure in these beams can simulate years of operation in space, air, or ground, effectively allowing users to perform accelerated testing of electronics components in the radiation conditions present in those environments. Annually, these testing facilities are used by around 45 companies including world renowned names such as Boeing and Cisco to ensure that their electronics will function reliably in higher radiation environments.

          <h3>Linac</h3>
          <h4 id="7">1) Stanford Linear Accelerator</h4>
          <p>
            Coming in at 3.2 kilometres long, the Stanford Linear Accelerator, the world's largest linac, has power to accelerate electrons to energies up to 50GeV. Its history is revolutionary having made a plethora of major discoveries in particle physics, solid-state physics, medicine, biology and chemistry. When construction began in 1962 it became known as "the monster" due to its incredible size and it remains a global centre of innovation in science to this day.

            SLAC works by accelerating electrons and positrons using powerful, alternating electric fields 9 metres underground in an evacuated tube to ensure that the particles are not slowed by collisions with molecules in the air. It would then collide the positrons and electrons which resulted in discoveries such as the Z-boson which carries the weak force.

            When construction of the Stanford Linear Accelerator was completed, its main focus was in particle physics where it was used to make groundbreaking discoveries. Soon after the accelerator reached full operation, a research team including SLAC and Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicists used the electron beam to discover that protons in the atomic nucleus were composed of smaller entities called quarks. Furthermore, in 1975, SLAC physicist Martin Perl announced the discovery of the tau lepton, a heavier version of the electron resulting in him sharing the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1995. These discoveries opened up a whole new family of Universal building blocks allowing modern particle physics as we know it to develop.

            The SLAC's scientific mission has diversified from its initial focus on particle physics and now encompasses a broad range of disciplines including cosmology, materials science, environmental science and alternative energy research. The linac produces ultrafast pulses of X-ray laser light a billion times brighter than any previous X-ray source which gives scientists incredible imaging abiities. Over the past few years, it has enabled scientists to uncover the 3-D molecular structure of proteins involved in the transmission of many important diseases, such as African sleeping sickness, Dengue fever and the Zika virus. It has also enabled the study of microscopic components of air pollution at the nano-scale as well as the study of the properties of supercooled water, which remains liquid well below its normal freezing temperature. Its applications are not just limited to the micro-scales, it has also been used to measure stress, strain and failure in advanced aerospace materials, and have studied how matter behaves under the extreme pressures that drive the formation of planets. This conveys the SLAC's ability to impact all areas of scientific research.

            The future is looking increasingly prosperous for the SLAC as a major upgrade to the facility, known as LCLS-II, is underway which will provide an extraordinary leap in its capabilities increasing the X-ray pulse repetition rate from 120 pulses per second to 1 million pulses per second! This will allow scinetists to explore biological systems, quantum events and rare chemical reactions in a higher resolution than ever before. There is no doubt that the SLAC is a world-class centre for innovation which pushes the boundaries of scientific knowledge in every direction. Fortunatley, there is no sign of this stopping anytime soon.
