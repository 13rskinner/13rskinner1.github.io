        <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
        <p>In the early 20th century, there was a growing demand by physicists to see the development of devices able to accelerate particles to high velocities. Until the development of particle accelerators, physicists had to rely on the emission of natural alpha particles with an energy of upto 8MeV, but Ernest Rutherford, an eminent British Physicist, believed that in order to observe the disintegration of heavier nuclei by alpha particles, it would be necessary to accelerate alpha particle ions artificially to even higher energies. However, at the time there appeared to be little hope of generating voltages sufficient enough to accelerate the ions to high enough velocities.

          However, significant research was being done to overcome these issues and in 1928 The principle of the linear resonance accelerator was demonstrated by Rolf Wideröe. From this, Ernest Lawrence implemented modifications to Wideröe’s linear resonance accelerator resulting in the creation of the first cyclotron in 1930 which had a diameter of a mere 4 inches. By the end of the 1930s, cyclotron energies had  reached about 25 MeV.

          Although the achievements of this period may at first appear limited, they provided the basis for the rapid developments which followed. For example, Cockcroft-Walton-type voltage multipliers and Van de Graaff generators developed in the 1930s are still employed as power sources for accelerators to this day.
        </p>
        <h3>Post-war boom</h3>
        <p>
          The creation of the atomic bomb during World War II and the nuclear arms race created by the cold war put nuclear research at the forefront of scientific research. There was a rapid advance in the science of accelerating particles with progress being led by Edwin Mattison McMillan at Berkeley and by Vladimir Iosifovich Veksler at Moscow. In 1945, they independently devised a method for maintaining  stable particle orbits in cyclic accelerators removing an apparent limitation on the energy of cyclotrons for protons. This enabled the creation of synchrotrons which is the principle of the main particle accelerator at the LHC.

          This discovery led to a plethora of synchrotrons being developed across the globe in the 1950s including  the Cosmotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory, which accelerated protons to about 3 GeV and the Proton Synchrotron at CERN. These early accelerators led to key discoveries such as the confirmation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe at the Bevatron in Berkley.

        <p>
          It wasn't just synchotrons being developed during this period with linear accelerators also being built. The most famous of which being the Stanford Linear Accelerator, commonly referred to as, <em>the monster.</em> After construction began in 1962, it became operational in 1966 and remains  the largest linear accelerator in existence with a length of 3km. It has played a major role in a number of major discoveries, the most famous of which being a discovery made soon after the acceleration reached full operation when a research team including SLAC and Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicists used the electron beam to discover that protons in the atomic nucleus were composed of smaller entities called quarks.

        <h3>The Age of Supercollidiers</h3>
        <p>
          By the end of the 1960s, a new age for partcicle accelerators was on the horizon as construction of the first supercollidiers, large (circular accelerators) began. One of the first was the Fermilab Tevatron which began construction in 1968 before finally sending its first particle beam around the full circle in 1971. Over the years many upgrades were made to it enabling energies of 512 GeV to be reached by 1983. This enabled discoveries such as the confirmation of the existence of the top quark and five baryons, which helped to test and refine the Standard Model. Other large colliders were also being developed around this time such as the Super Proton-antiproton Synchotron which operated at CERN from 1981 and enabled the discovery of the W and Z bosons which carry the weak force.

          The success of these colliders created a demand for even larger, more ambitious accelerators that could reach record breaking energies. For example, plans were made for the World's largest supercollidier in Texas with a ring circumference of 87km and the ability to reach record breaking energy levels of 20TeV per proton. Construction began but by 1993, major concerns were raised anout the cost of the project and it was ultimatley aborted. However, this wasn't the end for supercolliders as construction of the Large Hadron Collier was approved in 1995 which result in the development of the World's largest accelerator with a circumference of 27km and the ability to function at an energy of 14TeV. After finally being launched in 2009, it discovered the Higgs Boson in 2012 completing the Standard Model of Particle Physics and proving a prediction which had been made in the 1960s.

          Despite significant breakthroughs having already been made and the Standard Model being completed, there are still many un-answered questions in particle physics such as the existence of dark matter, whether supersymmetry is correct and the fact that the Standard Model cannot explain gravity. While the LHC has enabled us to confirm predictions made by the Standard Model, it has been unable to discover physics beyond it or discover new particles. It is believed by many physicists that to make these new discoveries, even larger, more powerful accelerators will be needed to obtain the energy required to create these new, exotic particles. To the delight of physicists across the globe, CERN has drawn up plans for the LHC's successor, the £20 billion, 100km circumference Future Circular Collider(FCC) which will be able to operate at energies ten times greater than that of the LHC. With the FCC, physicists hope to unify the fundamental forces of nature (strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravitational) to create a Grand Unified Theory. It is hoped that it will begin operating in 2050, first by colliding electrons with positrons, then electrons and protons before finally colliding protons together. The potential for discovery with a device like this is huge, but there is no guarantee that new particles will be discovered as our theories may be incorrect and this is making many governemnts question whether investing in such a project is resourceful. However, for many, the prospect of a Grand Unified Theory and unkown technological benefits will be too tantalising to turn down.
