        It’s fairly likely that you’ve heard of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the World’s largest particle accelerator with a circumference of 27km making it an incredible sight to behold. However, the world of particle accelerators extends much further than just the LHC with countless experiments going on across the globe using a plethora of different accelerating methods. If you want to understand more about how these different accelerators work and the research being done with them, then we’ve got exactly what you need.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s begin with the basics of particle accelerators:
      </p>
      <h3>1) What is a particle accelerator?</h3>

      <p>
        The clue is in the name. A particle accelerator, often referred to as an <em>"atom smasher"</em> or <em>"supercollider"</em> is a device which propels charged particles to extremely high speeds, up to 99.9999991% of the speed of light, using powerful electromagnetic fields. The 3 main types of accelerators which are used a Cyclotrons, Synchotrons and Linear Accelerators.
      </p>
      <h3>2) What are particle accelerators used for?</h3>
      <p>
        There are currently 30,000 particle accelerators worldwide, and contrary to what many people would think, they are not all used by physicists. Particles accelerators have a broad range of applications in fundamental research and industry.</p>
      <p>In research, physicists use particle accelerators to collide subatomic particles together to understand the building blocks of our Universe and the fundamental forces which govern their behaviour. In addition to that, particle accelerators are crucial in medicine and have benefitted countless patients worldwide. For example, the X-ray which used to diagnose your broken arm or cure a grandparent’s cancer relied on the acceleration of electrons to produce these X-rays. Furthermore, PET scans which provide internal images of the body to detect cancers or other diseases rely on isotopes which are produced in particle accelerators by firing neutrons at atoms. Particle accelerators have also opened up new ways to tackle cancer such as proton beam therapy which fires protons at tumours and has the advantage of reducing the risk of long term side effects which can be caused by radiotherapy allowing higher dosages to tumours in areas of the body that are sensitive to radiation.

        If that wasn’t enough, particle accelerators enable the creation of new materials, help us treat wastewater, monitor pollution and sterilise food as well as medical equipment. They also protect you from terrorists as X-rays produced by accelerating electrons enable the contents of passengers’ bags at airports to be seen. Furthermore, they play a key role in the development of computer chips which have helped create the digital age. Who knew particle accelerators were so versatile?

      <h3>3) What discoveries are physicists hoping to make with particle accelerators? </h3>

      <p>
        Mostly, physicists use particle accelerators to accelerate beams of particles to extremely high velocities (99.9999991% of the speed of light) before making these beams collide. This results in a plethora of new particles being created as the energy of the collision results in the formation of matter due to Einstein’s renowned equation E=mc^2. This allows physicists to discover new subatomic particles, such as the Higgs Boson at the LHC in 2012,  which are the fundamental building blocks of the  Universe. In the coming years, physicists hope to find new particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics which will help to explain some of the key problems of modern physics. For example, physicists are desperate to find a dark matter particle to explain why galaxies are rotating faster than expected and want to tackle the issue of why there is more matter than antimatter in the Universe.

      <h3>4) Are particle accelerators dangerous?</h3>
      <center>
        <p class="lead"><em>"To think that LHC particle collisions at high energies can lead to dangerous black holes is rubbish. Such rumors were spread by unqualified people seeking sensation or publicity"</em><div>Academician Vitaly Ginzburg, Nobel Laureate in Physics, Lebedev Institute, Moscow, and Russian Academy of Sciences</div>
      </center>
      <p>As the LHC was being planned many people in the public, media and in science expressed concerns about the safety of such a large, powerful particle accelerator with newspapers like <em>The Times</em> and <em>The Guardian</em> spreading doomesday fears. However, the collisions which occur there are actually pretty modest compared to the collisions which nature produces. Earth is bombarded by cosmic rays from space with far greater energies than those at the LHC and the Earth has survived pretty well over the last few billion years.
      </p>

        </figure>
      </center>
      <p>
        There were also fears that the collisions at the LHC could create microscopic black holes as large amounts of energy would be concentrated in a small area which could then go on to devour the entirety of Earth. However, these fears are unfounded as according to the well-established properties of gravity, described by Einstein’s relativity, it is impossible for microscopic black holes to be produced at the LHC. While some speculative theories predict black holes could be created, they would disintegrate in a process called Hawking radiation before they would begin accreting matter presenting no harm to Earth. Therefore, you do not have to worry about being devoured by a  black hole any time soon.

        </figure>
      </center>
      <p>
        Furthermore, it was feared that the high energy collisions at the LHC could create vacuum bubbles which would expand outwards at the speed of light and incinerate everything that they plough through. This is because it is believed that our Universe is not in its most stable configuration and that perturbations caused by the LHC could tip it into a more stable state, called a vacuum bubble, in which we could not exist. However, these fears are unfounded as far higher energy collisions occur each day through cosmic rays striking the earth and no catastrophic events have ever occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, you do not need to fear particle accelerators. They will not destroy the world or cause an existential crisis. It’s far better to look at the wealth of uses that particle accelerators have and how they have benefited society.

      <h3>5) When were the first particle accelerators built?</h3>

        The history of particle accelerators begins fairly recently with the first cyclotron, which was a mere 4 inches in diameter, being built in 1929 by Ernest Lawrence. From that moment onwards, the creation of particle accelerators has exploded and today, the largest particle accelerator in the world, the Large Hadron Collider, has a diameter of 8.6km.
