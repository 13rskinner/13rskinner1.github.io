      <h3>How do cyclotrons work?</h3
      <p>
        A cyclotron is formed of two semi-circular bodies called dees which are separated by a small gap from where the charged particle you wish to accelerate is initially ejected from. To ensure that the particles you wish to accelerate do not encounter interference from air particles, a vacuum is maintained within the accelerator. To accelerate the particle, an electric field is placed across the dees while a magnetic field is also applied to confine the particle. When the particle is ejected, it is accelerated across the gap due to the applied potential before entering the dee at a constant velocity. The magnetic field then applies a force on the charged particle confining it to a circular path. This causes the particle to arc back around to the gap between the dees once more.

        However, if the particle was to pass through the gap once again, it would be decelerated as it passes through it in the opposite direction. Therefore, the direction of the electric field is changed using an alternating potential. Each time the particle crosses the gap between the dees, the electric field changes direction causing the particle’s velocity to increase. Thankfully, the frequency at which the potential changes can remain constant for velocities far less than the speed of light because even though the velocity of the particle increases, its radius of orbit increases so the time it takes to reach the gap remains constant.

        If you enjoy an equation and don’t feel 100% satisfied that the time remains constant you can read this section, it will require basic knowledge of circular motion and magnetic fields:
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li>The force applied by the magnetic field on the particle= F</li>
            <li>The magnetic field strength= B</li>
            <li>The charge of the particle = q </li>
            <li>The velocity of the particle when entering the dee = v</li>
            <li>As the particle travels in circular motion, we can equate F= Bqv and F=mv^2/r:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Bqv = mv^2/r</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Re-arranging we get:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>r/v = m/bq</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Multiplying each side by 2π we get:</li>
            <ul>
              2πr/v = 2πm/bq
            </ul>
            <li>As 2πr/v = T, where T is the time period of rotation for an object obeying circular motion:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>T = 2πm/bq </li>
            </ul>
            <li>As all of the values which the time period of rotation is dependant on remain constant during the acceleration process, the time that it takes for the charged particle to reach the gap remains constant. This means that the frequncy of the oscillating potential difference can remain constant.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
      <p>
        When cyclotrons were first developed in the late 1920s, they had many advantages over the <a href="linac.html">Linacs</a> which were available at the time as they were more cost and space efficient because of  the iterated interaction of the particles with the accelerating field. At the time, to generate particles with large energies, impractically long linac structures were required. By being so compact, cyclotrons reduced other costs such as radiation shielding and enclosing the building while cyclotrons also have a single electrical driver which further reduces power consumption as well as cost. Furthermore, cyclotrons are able to produce a continuous stream of particles at the target, so the average power passed from a particle beam into a target is relatively high.

        However, cyclotrons do have limitations which occur as the particles are accelerated to relativistic (near light) speeds. This is because the path radius increases faster than the velocity of the particles causing the time per revolution to increase. This results in the beam becoming out of phase with the oscillating electric field so it cannot receive additional acceleration. Modifications can be made to counter this issue such as modifying the magnetic field accordingly by approximately shaping the poles of a magnet in a cyclotron or changing the frequency applied to dee's in a cyclotron. However, the other pressing issue is that to accommodate larger speeds, an extremely large radius is required which would need a vast electromagnet. Therefore, for high energy physics research , cyclotrons cannot produce particles of high enough energies and they have been superseded by synchrotrons and modern, klystron-driven linear accelerators both of which have the advantage of scalability, offering more power within an improved cost structure as the machines are made larger.

      <h3>Uses</h3>
      <p>
        Cyclotrons have many applications in industry and are most commonly used in medicine. Medical cyclotrons produce proton beams which are directed at atoms to manufacture radioisotopes which are used in Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to provide images of the body's internal structure in order to diagnose diseases such as cancer. Furthermore, cyclotrons can be used to treat cancer by producing ion beams which penetrate the body and kill tumours by radiation damage, while minimizing damage to healthy tissue along their path.

        However,due to the limitations we mentioned above, cyclotrons are no longer used in cutting-edge research in particle physics as they simply cannot produce the energies capable to probe the heart of matter.
